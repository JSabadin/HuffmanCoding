# Huffman Coding Implementation in C

This program efficiently implements Huffman Coding, a renowned algorithm for lossless data compression. Key functionalities include character frequency analysis, Huffman tree construction, and binary code generation for data encoding.

## Overview

- **Frequency Analysis**: Calculates the occurrence of each character in the input.
- **Huffman Tree**: Constructs an optimal tree using a priority queue based on character frequencies, ensuring the most frequent characters have the shortest codes.
- **Code Generation**: Derives unique, variable-length binary codes from the Huffman tree.

The implementation focuses on memory efficiency and algorithmic effectiveness, providing a robust solution for data compression tasks.
